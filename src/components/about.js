              certificates from courses like Community Manager, Electronic Commerce,
              and Cloud Computing. From a young age, Ricardo has always been curious

              them. Coding has always been one of his interests, and his passion for
              coding is what continues to impulse him on taking new challenges. He
              started university to get a bachelor's in Informatic Engineering, but
              the social-economic situation in his country led him to migrate.

              working to get the opportunity and determined to build his career in
